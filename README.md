This repo is an investigation into doing tensor transformations using space-filling curves. 

## Basic introduction
A *space-filling curve* is a path through a grid which covers the entire grid. (These paths are called curves, but really only have right angles). The *Hilbert curve* follows this path through a 4x4 grid.

Here is a simple 4x4 grid with the cells shuffled via this Hilbert curve.

This notebook walks through an explanation of how to capture neighborhoods of pixels in a way that is very friendly to deep learning. (The Colab link is better).

## Acknowledgements
All of the IPython notebooks were written and debugged on Google's Colab free tier. The Hilbert curve code was lifted from Aldo Cortesi's [scurve](https://github.com/cortesi/scurve) package for Python. It is only released for Python 2, so I ~~hacked it up~~ ported it to Python 3.
