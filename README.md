This repo is a collection of investigations into the benefits of using space-filling curves in deep learning.

## Basic introduction
A space-filling curve is a path through a grid which covers the entire grid, and only touches each square once. There are various types of such paths. The Hilbert space-filling curve is one of a family of such paths. Unlike some paths, the Hilbert space-filling curve is self-similar (fractal) and has really interesting properties for analyzing multi-dimensional data.

This notebook walks through an explanation of how to capture neighborhoods of pixels in a way that is very friendly to deep learning. (The Colab link is better).

## Acknowledgements
All of the IPython notebooks were written and debugged on Google's Colab free tier. The Hilbert curve code was lifted from Aldo Cortesi's [scurve](https://github.com/cortesi/scurve) package for Python. It is only released for Python 2, so I -hacked it up- ported it to Python 3.
